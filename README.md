# MSU work day page

-in this challenge, i was tasked to create a time based work day schuduler using javascript on the developed code.


# Work day schuduler

-In this code it uses the time of the day with day.js to compare it to the users time and then edits the css to show what time it is on it. Then it allows the user to input lists or notes onto the page which is then put back in using the localstorage and the dom.

-This code includes css, html, javascript and jquery.
